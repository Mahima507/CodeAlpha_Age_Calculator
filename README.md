    script.js

 # HTML:

The HTML file, index.html, will contain the necessary structure to create the age calculator form. It will include an input field for entering the birthdate, a button to calculate the age, and placeholders to display the calculated age.

 #   CSS:

The index.css file will handle the visual presentation of the age calculator form. You can customize the styling based on your preference to create an appealing user interface. 

# JS:

The script.js file will contain the JavaScript code responsible for performing the age calculation, handling user input, and updating the HTML elements dynamically. It will include functions to check for future dates, calculate the age, and display the result.
